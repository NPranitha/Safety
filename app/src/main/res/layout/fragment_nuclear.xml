Nuclear Radiation: being prepared in advance in case of Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) Event\n\n
- Taking shelter during an RDD event is necessary. There are two kinds of shelters: blast and fallout. The following describes the two kinds of shelters:\n
        Blast shelters are specifically constructed to offer some protection against blast pressure, initial radiation, heat, and fire. But even a blast shelter cannot withstand a direct hit from a nuclear explosion.\n          Fallout shelters do not need to be specially constructed for protecting against fallout. They can be any protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough to absorb the radiation given off by fallout particles.\n\nDuring a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) Event\nOutdoors\n            1.Seek shelter indoors immediately in the nearest undamaged building.\n\n
            2.If appropriate shelter is not available, cover your nose and mouth and move as rapidly as is safe upwind, away from the location of the explosive blast. Then, seek appropriate shelter as soon as possible.\n\n          3.Listen for official instructions and follow directions.\n\nIndoors\n          1.If you have time, turn off ventilation and heating systems, close windows, vents, fireplace dampers, exhaust fans, and clothes dryer vents.\n\n         2.Retrieve your disaster supplies kit and a battery-powered radio and take them to your shelter room.\n\n         3.Seek shelter immediately, preferably underground or in an interior room of a building, placing as much
distance and dense shielding as possible between you and the outdoors where the radioactive material may
be.\n\n         4.Seal windows and external doors that do not fit snugly with duct tape to reduce infiltration of
 radioactive particles. Plastic sheeting will not provide shielding from radioactivity nor from blast effects of a
 nearby explosion.\n\nAfter finding safe shelter, those who may have been exposed to radioactive material should decontaminate themselves. To do this, remove and bag your clothing (and isolate the bag away from you and others), and shower thoroughly with soap and water. Seek medical attention after officials indicate it is safe to leave shelter. Contamination from an RDD event could affect a wide area, depending on the amount of conventional explosives used, the quantity and type of radioactive material released, and meteorlogical conditions."
